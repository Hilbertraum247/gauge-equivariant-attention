# Gauge equivariant Attention

Hello,

welcome to my bachelor project "gauge equivariant Attention" :)
This is part of my work and shall serve as a Testing ground for future studies for myself and anyone how is
interested. 
As the name suggest the main goal of this code was to create a gauge equivariant version of the Attention model
that was used as a core part to create ChatGPT 3.5!
To find out why a gauge equivariant version of this could be of interest, have a look into my bachelors thesis
(if you haven't already)

My code of course is not limited to create Attention models so feel free to implement whatever might be useful.
Read the description of the configuration filed to find out how they can be used.
